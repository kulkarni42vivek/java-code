// static can be method , variable , nested class
// static is used for the memory management
// static - gets memory once it is loaded
//If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.
//A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
//A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
//A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.
